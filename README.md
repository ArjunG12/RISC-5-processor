# RISC-5-processor

In this project, we design and implement a 32-bit processor based on the RISC-V ISA using Verilog. The sub-modules involved and their interactions are illustrated in the diagram below.

Currently, our processor supports only R-type instructions, but weâ€™ll be adding support for lw, sw, and jmp instructions very soon. Stay tuned!
